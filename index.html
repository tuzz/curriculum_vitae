        <h3>Personal Statement</h3>

        <p>
        I am an experienced polyglot engineer and mentor with an aptitude for
        delivering software projects at all stages in their life cycle. I
        specialise in Ruby, Rails, object-oriented design and test-driven
        development. I focus on building high quality, maintainable products
        that meet clients' needs.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have been the technical lead on both greenfield and legacy
        applications and have acted in a solution architect's capacity to design
        logical solutions that meet business requirements. I have led
        initiatives that tackle technical debt and carry out significant
        architectural change, whilst delivering business value.

        <h3>Employment History</h3>

        <h4>
        Government Digital Service
        <br/>
        October 2015 &ndash; Present
        </h4>

        <p>
        I'm currently working at GDS, helping to build their Publishing
        Platform.
        </p>

        <h4>
        Which?
        <br/>
        June 2014 &ndash; September 2015
        </h4>

        <p>
        I worked as technical lead for the engineering team and designed the
        logical solution to the business's highest profile project alongside a
        solution architect. I then worked inside of the Ruby on Rails
        development team to realise this solution. Through collaboration, I
        defined coding standards and development practices, then governed their
        use across the organisation.
        </p>

        <p>
        I built much of the engineering team from the ground-up, recruiting both
        permanent and contract staff in London and for an offshore team in
        Sofia. I line managed as many as ten developers and was responsible for
        their technical career progression. I ran training sessions for the
        wider engineering team and supported our quality assurance specialists
        in their transition from Java to Ruby.
        </p>

        March 2014 &ndash; June 2014
        </h4>

        <p>
        I worked on the Staff Assisted Applications team, developing native
        iOS applications for internal stakeholders. I designed and implemented
        the automation process for testing and packaging applications. I ran
        a workshop at the London Software Craftsmanship Community that educated
        attendees in test-driven development practices.
        </p>

        <h4>
        Reevoo
        <br/>
        August 2012 &ndash; March 2014
        </h4>

        <p>
        I worked on Reevoo's core product set, written in Ruby on Rails. I led
        the team as a technical lead through a large architectural refactor that
        would enable the business to move forward with tactical initiatives. I
        worked on system integrations with external clients, as well as
        providing technical support to internal stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>
        I ran a hack week outside of London for the engineering team. We
        innovated on new products and features, then rapidly prototyped them to
        learn which ideas had merit. I facilitated discussions and team events
        and provided technical guidance for the development and measurement of
        prototypes.
        </p>

        <h4>
        Unboxed Consulting
        <br/>
        August 2011 &ndash; August 2012
        </h4>

        <p>
        I worked on a wide-range of bespoke Ruby on Rails applications
        throughout London. These were based on- and off-site and a portion of my
        role was to provide agile consultancy services. I integrated with
        diverse teams and acquired a proficiency for getting up-to-speed
        quickly. I developed and ran a Ruby on Rails training programme for
        interns, colleagues and paying customers of mixed ability.

        <h3>Higher Education</h3>

        <h4>
        BSc Computer Science (1st Class)
        <br/>
        September 2008 &ndash; June 2011
        </h4>

        <p>
        I graduated from the University of Southampton with an honours in
        Computer Science and a strong foundation in a multitude of subjects,
        including:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Hypertext and Web Technologies</li>
          <li>Large Scale Distributed Systems</li>
          <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
          <li>Advanced Databases</li>
          <li>Theory of Computation</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        My final year project was titled 'Simulated Autonomous Exploration'. It
        modelled a physical environment and placed an agent within it. The
        agent's task was to explore its environment autonomously using
        intelligent strategies.
