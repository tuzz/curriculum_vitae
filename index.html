        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
        I am an experienced software developer and technical architect. I
        specialise in delivering complex web applications for clients, using
        agile methodologies to incrementally create value. I am passionate
        about designing elegant solutions to problems, then working in
        collaboration with development teams to implement them effectively.

          The Rights eXchange

          </h4>

          <p>
          I picked up a short contract at TRX, a television rights platform. I
          encouraged pair programming and rebuilt the 'account settings' features
          of their app in React. I worked on a LinkedIn integration and photo
          upload feature. I helped de-risk their deployment process and introduced
          Terraform to simplify the creation of new QA environments.

          Babylon Health
          <span class="right">April 2018 &ndash; November 2018</span>
          </h4>

          <p>
          I joined Babylon Health during a period of rapid growth. The company
          wanted to scale its platform to meet the operational needs of an
          increasing user base. I designed an architectural solution to enable
          this growth for one of its core offerings. I then worked to implement
          it within the constraints of a monolith-to-microservices migration.

          <p>
          I returned to GDS for a second contract which lasted another year. I
          architected and built a service that used GOV.UK Notify to deliver
          approximately 500 million emails per year. I joined the Reliability
          Engineering team and developed a platform to provide application,
          database and container metrics to hundreds of Government services.

          I worked alongside a designer to completely rebuild their shopping site.
          I built a fully responsive frontend and a sophisticated backend using a
          series of APIs and an Elasticsearch cluster to provide filtering and
          search capabilities. The site had strict requirements around SEO and
          required an incremental roll-out plan to mitigate risk.

          <p>
          I designed and built the Publishing Platform which provides a set of
          APIs to manage the workflow of all content on GOV.UK. I helped rescue a
          failing project and became technical lead on the Specialist Publishing
          team to migrate an application away from a complex Hexagonal pattern to
          a simpler architecture on the new platform.

          <p>
          In my capacity as technical lead, I worked closely with a solution
          architect to design the organisation's highest profile project then
          worked inside the development team to implement it. I helped define
          coding standards, best practices and ran a technical training programme.
          I built a development team in London and an offshore team in Eastern
          Europe.

          I worked on the Staff Assisted Applications team, developing native
          iOS applications for internal stakeholders. I built a continuous
          delivery pipeline for testing and packaging applications. I ran a
          workshop on the topic of test-driven development.

          I worked as technical lead to re-architect a large monolithic web
          application into smaller services that could be reused across the
          product set. I worked on system integrations with external clients and
          ran a hack week outside London for the engineering team. We rapidly
          prototyped new features and products for the business.

          I worked on diverse teams and projects across London to develop new
          features, fix bugs and make general application improvements. A part of
          my role was to provide agile consultancy services to help organisations
          deliver value incrementally. I ran a training programme for interns,
          junior colleagues and paying customers.
