      <h3>Personal Statement</h3>

      <p>I am a passionate and self-motivated web developer with a strong
      background in computer science and an aptitude for delivering high-quality,
      maintainable software. I have extensive knowledge of the Ruby programming
      language and a lot of experience working on bespoke Rails applications and
      their respective ecosystems.</p>

      <p>I have led teams and projects to tackle technical debt and have completed
      large architectural refactors, whilst delivering business value. I have made
      decisions on mission critical code and successfully developed tools and
      methodologies to deal with high levels of risk.</p>

      <p>I am actively involved in a number of development communities and
      regularly attend conferences, having spoken at one myself. I am a strong
      advocate for open-source development, encouraging colleagues to work on
      projects that they find captivating and inspiring.</p>

      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering, slacklining, cycling, running
      and playing the guitar. I have competed in two half marathons and a
      duathlon. In 2012, I ran in excess of 900km. I used to play in a rhythm and soul
      band.</p>

      <h3>Higher Education</h3>

      <h4>
        2008 &#8211; 2011:
        BSc Computer Science (1st Class)
        - University of Southampton
      </h4>

      <p>I graduated from Southampton with an honours in Computer Science and a
      rock solid foundation in programming. Some of my favourite modules are
      listed below:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Large Scale Distributed Systems</li>
        <li>Scripting Languages</li>
        <li>Advanced Databases</li>
        <li>Principles of Computer Graphics</li>
        <li>Hypertext and Web Technologies</li>
        <li>Computer Vision</li>
        <li>Advanced Computer Networks</li>
      </ol>

      <p>My final year project was titled 'Simulated Autonomous Exploration'. I
      modelled a physical environment and placed a robot within it. The robot's
      task was the explore its environment autonomously using intelligent
      strategies.</p>

      <p>The project was a significant programming and architectural challenge and
      touched many fields in Computer Science, such as artificial intelligence,
      computer graphics and data modelling. It was heavily maths based and
      required comprehensive software testing.</p>

      <h3>Employment History</h3>

      <h4>
        2011 &#8211; 2012:
        Ruby on Rails Developer and Agile Consultant
        - Unboxed Consulting
      </h4>

      <p>Unboxed Consulting enabled me to work as a contractor on a wide-range of
      bespoke projects throughout London. I integrated with diverse teams and
      developed a proficiency for getting up to speed quickly. I learnt a huge
      amount about Rails, Test-driven Development and Agile workflows.</p>

      <p>I ran a week-long Ruby on Rails training course for interns, colleagues
      and paying customers of mixed abilities. My final contractual work was at
      Reevoo, who were impressed with my abilities to the extent that they bought
      me out from the contracting company for a significant fee.</p>

      <br />

      <h4>
        2012 &#8211; Present:
        Team Lead and Senior Developer
        - Reevoo
      </h4>

      <p>I joined Reevoo as a Senior Developer and was quickly promoted to Team
      Lead. During that time, I worked on complicated system integrations and
      large architectural refactors. I headed up difficult technical decisions and
      participated in prioritisation meetings and external client calls. I
      provided support for the rest of the business on technical issues.</p>

      <p>I ran a Hack Week outside of London for the Engineering team. The goals
      were to innovate and invent new products, or additional features for
      existing products. I facilitated discussions and all team events. I guided
      engineers from inception through to rapid prototyping and measuring their
      successes.</p>

      <p>My responsibilities as Team Lead included interviewing numerous
      candidates and covering for the engineering manager. I have extensive
      experience of managing difficult situations and the clarity to make good
      decisions under pressure. I am committed to delivering the highest quality
      of software craftsmanship alongside sustainable processes to ensure the
      success of agile development teams.</p>
